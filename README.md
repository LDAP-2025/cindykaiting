How relationships during the pandemic (status, cohabiting partners, relationship satisfaction, relationship conflict, etc....) might predict later mental health outcomes. 
Hypothesize that in relationship (living together) would lead to increased relationship conflict and possibly divorce. 
Confounds might be sex, SES, financial situation, employment status, kids, rooms in the household, pregnancy. 

Social contact,
social support and
loneliness 
Mental health 
Overall life satisfaction 
Life events 
Optimism 
risk
patience

## QUESTION: 
# Constrain: set a1 a2 to be the same, etc.. first only for AR, and then with constrained CL. 
# Measurement invariance- is latent factor at T1 andT2 the same. First fit the model, then fir another model in which you constrain the loadings. Latent- assign them the same labels. When you don't assign lable syou are freely assigning them, calling them freely. Constrain them to be the same T1 X1 = T2 X1. Then you compare the models, which one fits better- constrained VS freely estimated model. Another when where we constrain the residual variance to be the same. 
# Constrain first AR paths, and then test the betas. AR can be constrained to be the same, then the CL add in constrain as well. Then do the nested difference, chi squared test. 

# Then, is the effect of A on B, then the effect of B on A, si ti the same thing. Gamma= 0.6, beta= 0.4, they are teh same. Gamma equals beta, fit the model, si ti a better fit. Compare. I have different coefficients, but given this I have no evidence tha tone is better than the other. Constrain and then realize it is not the same, so Anxiety better predictor of Depression over time. Are gamma and beta significantly different? 

1) Start with longitudinal variance- latent variable. 
2) Cross lagged path. 

# Network option T1 to T2/ T2 to T3.

# **** Redo with constraining the coefficients to be the same, AR, CL, compare them.
